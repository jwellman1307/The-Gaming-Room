# The-Gaming-Room

  The Gaming Room is a client looking to develop a web-based game that would serve on multiple platforms based on their current game Draw It or Lose It that is currently available on an Andriod app. I did well in researching the different options for the best way to integrate an Android app into a web-based system. The process of working through the design document gave me an idea of what was trying to be accomplished and options for the best path to get there. If I could choose a section to revise, it would be reviewing the development requirements. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because it will ultimately affect the user and their satisfaction is why we design. I approached software design from an analytical level. To understand what to create, we must first understand the expectations and requirements needed to accomplish the next steps of development.
